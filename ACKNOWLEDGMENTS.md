# Acknowledgments

## Original Implementation

This project is a JavaScript port of the excellent Ruby implementation by **synthead**:
- **Original Repository**: [timex_datalink_client](https://github.com/synthead/timex_datalink_client)
- **Author**: [synthead](https://github.com/synthead)

The original Ruby gem provided the foundation for understanding the Timex Datalink protocols and served as the reference implementation for this JavaScript port. While this codebase has been completely rewritten for the web platform, the protocol logic, packet structures, and validation rules are based on the meticulous reverse engineering work done in the original project.

## Key Differences from Original

This JavaScript implementation:
- **Target Platform**: Web browsers instead of Ruby command-line
- **Communication**: Web Serial API instead of Ruby serial gems
- **Architecture**: Modular ES6 classes instead of Ruby modules
- **Interface**: Web-based GUI instead of command-line interface
- **Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript instead of Ruby gems

## Protocol Documentation

The protocol documentation and device compatibility information in this project builds upon the research and documentation from the original Ruby implementation.

## Hardware References

- **Timex Corporation**: For creating these innovative devices in the 1990s
- **NASA**: For certifying these watches for space travel
- **Arduino Community**: For creating compatible hardware adapters
- **Reverse Engineering Community**: For documenting the protocols

## Special Thanks

- **synthead**: For the original Ruby implementation and protocol research
- **Timex Datalink Community**: For preserving and documenting these vintage devices
- **Web Serial API Team**: For making browser-based serial communication possible
- **Contributors**: Everyone who helps improve and maintain this project
- **Claude** Almost all of the code is generated by Claude Sonnet 4.0 using Kiro. In general, I have no idea of what Im doing. 

## Historical Context

The Timex Datalink watches were groundbreaking devices that predated modern smartwatches by decades. This project helps preserve the ability to use these vintage devices with modern computers, ensuring they remain functional for collectors and enthusiasts.

## License Compatibility

This project is released under the MIT License, which is compatible with the original Ruby implementation's license. Both projects aim to keep these vintage devices usable and preserve computing history.
