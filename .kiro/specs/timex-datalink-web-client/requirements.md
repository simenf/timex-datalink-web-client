# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves porting the existing Ruby Timex Datalink Client library to JavaScript using the Web Serial API, and creating a modern web application that closely resembles the original Windows 98 software. The web app will enable users to synchronize all types of data with their vintage Timex Datalink watches through their browser, including modern integrations like Google Calendar sync.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Web Serial API Library Port

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a JavaScript library that replicates the Ruby Timex Datalink Client functionality, so that I can communicate with Timex Datalink watches from web browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is initialized THEN it SHALL provide the same protocol support as the Ruby version
2. WHEN Protocol 3 is used THEN the system SHALL maintain byte-for-byte compatibility with the original Ruby implementation
3. WHEN serial communication occurs THEN the system SHALL use Web Serial API instead of Ruby's UART gem
4. WHEN data validation is needed THEN the system SHALL implement JavaScript equivalents of ActiveModel validations
5. WHEN packets are compiled THEN the system SHALL produce identical byte arrays to the Ruby version
6. WHEN timing parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL preserve byte_sleep and packet_sleep functionality

### Requirement 2: Protocol 3 Implementation Priority

**User Story:** As a user with a Protocol 3 compatible Timex Datalink watch, I want full communication support, so that I can sync all my watch data through the web browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Protocol 3 is implemented THEN the system SHALL support all Protocol 3 features (time, alarms, EEPROM data, sound options, etc.)
2. WHEN Protocol 3 communication starts THEN the system SHALL properly initialize with start/sync sequences
3. WHEN Protocol 3 data is written THEN the system SHALL support bidirectional communication where available
4. WHEN Protocol 3 operations complete THEN the system SHALL properly terminate with end sequences

### Requirement 3: Windows 98 Style Web Application

**User Story:** As a nostalgic user, I want a web application that looks and feels like the original Windows 98 Timex Datalink software, so that I can have an authentic retro experience while using modern browser capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web app loads THEN it SHALL display a Windows 98-style interface with appropriate fonts, colors, and UI elements
2. WHEN users interact with controls THEN the system SHALL use Windows 98-style buttons, dialogs, and form elements
3. WHEN windows are displayed THEN they SHALL include proper title bars, borders, and window controls
4. WHEN the interface is rendered THEN it SHALL be responsive while maintaining the retro aesthetic
5. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL provide familiar Windows 98-style menus and navigation patterns

### Requirement 4: Full Bidirectional Sync Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to read data from my watch and write data to my watch, so that I can maintain full synchronization between my watch and modern services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync operations are initiated THEN the system SHALL support both reading from and writing to the watch
2. WHEN data is read from the watch THEN the system SHALL parse and display current watch settings and data
3. WHEN data is written to the watch THEN the system SHALL validate and format data according to protocol specifications
4. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide user options for resolution
5. IF bidirectional sync is not supported for specific data types THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate write-only functionality

### Requirement 5: Google Calendar Integration

**User Story:** As a modern user, I want to sync my Google Calendar events to my Timex Datalink watch, so that I can see my daily appointments on my vintage watch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Calendar integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Google Calendar API
2. WHEN calendar events are retrieved THEN the system SHALL fetch today's events and upcoming appointments
3. WHEN events are processed THEN the system SHALL convert them to watch-compatible appointment format
4. WHEN appointments are synced THEN the system SHALL respect watch memory limitations and prioritize by time/importance
5. WHEN calendar sync completes THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on successful transfers and any limitations

### Requirement 6: Device Connection and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily connect and manage my Timex Datalink watch connection, so that I can reliably communicate with my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL provide clear device connection interface using Web Serial API
2. WHEN device connection is attempted THEN the system SHALL detect and list available serial devices
3. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL verify communication with the watch
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful troubleshooting information
5. WHEN multiple protocols are supported THEN the system SHALL auto-detect or allow manual protocol selection

### Requirement 7: Future Protocol Expansion

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the architecture to support adding additional protocols after Protocol 3, so that the system can eventually support all Timex Datalink variants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library architecture is designed THEN it SHALL accommodate easy addition of Protocol 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9
2. WHEN new protocols are added THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interface patterns as Protocol 3
3. WHEN protocol selection occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a framework for protocol-specific features
4. WHEN multiple protocols coexist THEN the system SHALL handle protocol-specific validation and data structures
5. WHEN the web app supports multiple protocols THEN it SHALL adapt the UI to show protocol-appropriate features
